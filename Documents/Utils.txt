3 - Authentication

You must authenticate to use navitia.io. When you register we give you a authentication key to the API.
There is two ways for authentication, you can use a Basic HTTP authentication, where the username is the key, and without password.
The other method is to pass directly the key in the HTTP Authorization header like that:
Authorization: mysecretkey
